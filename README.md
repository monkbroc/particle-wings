# Fly, Little Particle, Fly!

Give wings to your Particle Core or Photon using this stackable piggyback board.

### [Order this PCB on OSH Park](oshpark)

## What it's good for

Use this to connect extra wires, headers, LEDs to a Photon or Core already mounted in an existing project/PCB.

I use this to connect the [Programmer Shield] to a Photon in an existing circuit.


## Assembly instructions

[Buy the PCB from OSH Park](oshpark)

Solder a row of [12-pin stackable headers](headers-12) or 2 [6-pin stackable headers](headers-6) to each middle column of holes (the one bordered by the white rectangle).

Then solder other wires, headers, etc to the other columns of holes.
